NAME
====

ValueList - Provide an immutable List value type

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use ValueList;

my @a is ValueList = ^10;  # initialization follows single-argument semantics
my @b is ValueList = ^10;

set( @a, @b );  # elems == 1
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Raku provides a semi-immutable Positional datatype: List. A `List` can not have any elements added or removed from it. However, since a list **can** contain containers of which the value can be changed, it is not a value type. So you cannot use Lists in data structures such as `Set`s, because each List is considered to be different from any other List, because they are not value types.
