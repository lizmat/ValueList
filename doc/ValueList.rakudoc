=head1 NAME

ValueList - Provide an immutable List value type

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use ValueList;

my @a is ValueList = ^10;  # initialization follows single-argument semantics
my @b is ValueList = ^10;

set( @a, @b );  # elems == 1
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Raku provides a semi-immutable C<Positional> datatype: List.  A C<List> can
not have any elements added or removed from it.  However, since a list B<can>
contain containers of which the value can be changed, it is not a value type.
So you cannot use Lists in data structures such as C<Set>s, because each List
is considered to be different from any other List, because they are not value
types.
